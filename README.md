## About Project
The Project aims for detecting the different monuments of India and giving the correct output. The purpose of the project is that, As there are physically disable people in our country, this project would help to get to know about the different monuments of the country and about the history associated with the monuments. For Eg : For the blind person, When the camera of the phone detects the monument object, then from the help of Text to speech, the Assoaciated Application or if we have the Goggle for the blind person then it help to get out the information and hence would helped the blind person. In this case the different monuments detected are : **Taj Mahal, Statue of Unity, Gateway of India, Hawa Mahal, Mysore Palace**. Also for text to speech conversion I have created dictionary, that would really help out. 

## Detailed Explanation about Project
* First we would link the Google drive with the Google Colab as we are running the code on Google colab for faster processing due to usage of GPU. Also the version used here for tensorflow is 1.15.2
   ```
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   %cd '/content/drive/My Drive/Monuments Of India/'
   ```
   
* Then will define the number of training steps - `1000` and number of the evaluation steps - `50`. Thr number of evaluation step is to check the model performance on non train data. Now we would define the model configuration, so I would be using `SSD Mobile Net V2 configuration` - SSD is single shot multibox detector. SSD is thr type of the object detection technique which has reached new records in terms of performance and precision for object detection tasks, scoring over 74% mAP (mean Average Precision) at 59 frames per second on standard datasets such as PascalVOC and COCO. Single Shot: this means that the tasks of object localization and classification are done in a single forward pass of the network. MultiBox: this is the name of a technique for bounding box regression. Detector: The network is an object detector that also classifies those detected objects. 
  ```
  'ssd_mobilenet_v2': {
        'model_name': 'ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29',
        'pipeline_file': 'ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco.config',
        'batch_size': 12
  }
  ```
  
* Then I have taken `80:20` train vs test images. With this images, I have generated the XML files and then converted train folder annotation xml files to a single csv file. Same is done with test folder annotation xml files to a single csv file.
    ```
    !python xml_to_csv.py -i data/Images/train -o data/annotations/train_labels.csv -l data/annotations  ---> For Train Images
  	!python xml_to_csv.py -i data/Images/test -o data/annotations/test_labels.csv --------------------------> For Text Images
    ```

* Next is to generate the TFRecords for both train and text images csv files. The TFRecord format is a simple format for storing a sequence of binary records. For future using purpose we need to store up the train record name as train_record_name & test record name as the test_record_name.
    ```
    !python generate_tfrecord.py --csv_input=data/annotations/train_labels.csv --output_path=data/annotations/train.record --img_path=data/Images/train --label_map data/annotations/label_map.pbtxt
    !python generate_tfrecord.py --csv_input=data/annotations/test_labels.csv --output_path=data/annotations/test.record --img_path=data/Images/test --label_map data/annotations/label_map.pbtxt
    ```

* Now to download the Mobilenet SSD v2 Model and then we would be setting TensorFlow pretrained model checkpoint for better proecessing of the model
  ```
  fine_tune_checkpoint = os.path.join(DEST_DIR, "model.ckpt")
  fine_tune_checkpoint    
  ```
 
* Then we would be Configuring a Training Pipeline, so first we would be joining the pipeline file to already existing folder of `/content/models/research/object_detection/samples/configs/`, giving the name - `pipeline_fname` and then with use of `assert` we would be checking if `pipeline_fname` exist or not. The `assert` statement simply takes input a boolean condition, which when returns true doesnâ€™t return anything, but if it is computed to be false, then it raises an AssertionError along with the optional message provided. So here the error message is printed using `.format()` in python. `str.format()` is one of the string formatting methods in Python3, which allows multiple substitutions and value formatting. This method lets us concatenate elements within a string through positional formatting. Its syntax is `Syntax : { } .format(value)` -> (value) : Can be an integer, floating point numeric constant, string, characters or even variables.
    ```
    import os
  	pipeline_fname = os.path.join('/content/models/research/object_detection/samples/configs/', pipeline_file)
    assert os.path.isfile(pipeline_fname), '`{}` not exist'.format(pipeline_fname)
    ```
